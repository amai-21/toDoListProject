This is my attempt at creating a To-Do-List! 
Wish me luck!

Create UserInput: (finished)
-Textbox
-Submit Button

Saving and storing user inputs:
-Store it
-Display the task on string
-Indicate if it's already finished or unfinished.
    -Red text if it's not finished yet and a red x.
    -If finished, move the finished task to another side of the screen
        where the text is green, a check mark next ot the tasks and under a large "Finished" tag.
